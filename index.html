  <p>ANYWAYS here's a brief intro: </p>
  <p>I'm a student at River Hill and I like to do a lot of things. I like to play sports, try different foods and explore different things. I also like to take pictures in my free time of things like sports, nature or even just the bustling streets of a city. I also love to hang out with my friends and mess around with them. </p>
